# non-og-donut.c

This is not the original donut.c program
IDK how to program in c and i just pasted it from the website of a guy who wrote it
Donut.c is the code file, Donut.out is the compiled one
Download the Donut.c file and compile it with:-
gcc Donut.c -w

(-w is to ignore warnings for errors so it forces it to compile)
Look up how to compile c code on windows becoz idk how to do it on windows. This works on mac and linux for sure (if your macos install and linux distro have c compiler pre-built)
This probs works on windows
I just don't know how tho
